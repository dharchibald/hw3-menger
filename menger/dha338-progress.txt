Currently, I have completed work on the Menger sponge geometry, but still need to hook
up the buttons to dynamically change the geometry displayed, though I don't think that
will be too hard. I've also fixed the view matrix so that a proper perspective view 
generated from the camera position is created, but I'm still working on orbital rotation
so I can't be too sure that the perspective is working completely as intended. From here,
I just need to be able to work out the implementation of the camera manipulations in the
different modes and then I'll be pretty close to done.
